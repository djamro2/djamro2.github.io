			<p>Hey! I'm Dan, and it seems many people these days have their own site, so here's mine!</p>
			<p><strong class="firstWord">Past:</strong> I started my life differently than most, being born in a foreign country. I was born in Krakow, Poland, and moved to the Chicago suburbs when I was 5. Some of my first hobbies involved messing around on the computer. Eventually, this hobby took a more serious turn and I spent my time learning useful and fun things I could do with code. Sorry to many people, but in fact, one of the first things I made was a spam bot for Youtube with Visual Basic. I would later make things people could actually use, such as apps for the Android market.</p>
			<p><strong class="firstWord">Present:</strong> Currently, I'm a computer science student at the University of Illinois - Urbana/Champaign. In my first year, I've had my CS eyes opened to many new things. However, what has really stuck out to me through clubs such WebMonkeys and Financial Engineering Club, is, as you might guess it, web development and trading programmatically. I currently have a rough project for trade analysis in forex. Another one of my projects is more structured, a website which provides info of online deals to consumers. Both should be on my GitHub to see!  </p>
